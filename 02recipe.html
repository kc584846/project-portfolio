<h1> Tortilla Pizzas </h1>
<h2> Author: Cookie and Kate </h2>

<h3> This is a simple Tortilla Pizza recipe that was originally posted to cookieandkate.com. </h3>
 
<h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
<li>1 whole wheat tortilla (or whole wheat pita bread)</li>
<li>1/4 cup sauce (marinara, pesto, olive oil and garlic, barbecue sauce)</li>
<li>1/3 cup or less shredded/crumbled cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, goat, feta)</li>
<li>Toppings (go wild!)</li>
        </ul>

<p> <strong>Instructions</strong> </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<p> Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below).  </p>
<p> Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges. </p>
<p>    Sprinkle with cheese and toppings. </p>
<p> Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned. Slice and serve. </p>

<p> <strong>Notes</strong> </p>
If you don’t have a cast iron skillet I highly recommend getting one, but you can use an oven-safe baking rack or bake it directly on the rack of your toaster oven instead. 
<ul>    <li>Bake at 400 degrees for 8 to 11 minutes.</li> <li>Do not use a regular baking sheet because the bottom of the tortilla will not get crispy, your cheese will slide right off and you’ll wish you ordered out.</li>
    <ul>

<p> Although I have not tried it personally, Kim tried making tortilla pizzas in her cast iron skillet on a gas grill and said they turned out great!
Make sure to check the ingredients list on the whole wheat tortillas. It should list about 5 ingredients, not 25. I buy mine at health food stores and store them in the fridge or freezer and they almost never go bad. </p>

Topping ideas:

As shown: 
        <ul> <li>barbecue sauce (trust me), fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, fresh or defrosted frozen pineapple (canned pineapple is not as good).</li>
<li>Basil pesto, feta, fresh or roasted bell peppers (jarred is fine), sliced kalamata olives, chopped red onion, sliced cherry tomatoes. </li>
<li>Arugula pesto, basil pesto or light marinara sauce, mozzarella (optional), fresh arugula and parmesan shavings added after baking (like this).</li>
<li>Red pepper pesto and goat cheese.<li>
Anything you want!
            </ul>
