        <h2>Designing With Details</h2>
        <p>Dan Saffer</p>
        <p id="link"> <a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2784294/video/89543518">Watch Me</a> </p>
        <p>This video talks about the little details involving digital media. It will discuss the "structure of microinteractions—Triggers, Rules, Feedback, and Loops—and talk about why you should: Bring The Data Forward, Don’t Start From Zero, Use What is Often Overlooked, and Long Loops." The little details make up the massive things in life, and it's the little details that we should notice. For example, silencing your phone is an example of a microinteraction that we tend to overlook. They change the overall user experience. Examples include: change a setting, sync data, log in, favorite/like. Manuel triggers are when you physically press something and something else happens. Rules are set so systems are not abused. A principle for microinteractions is preventing human error. There is always something - something to be created, altered, changed - to do something else. Paying attention to detail makes us the consumer feel as if our needs are met.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Microinteraction: Single functionality contained moments that do one thing and do it well.</li>
            <li>System triggers: Set of conditions are met and those conditions trigger a microinteraction.</li>
            <li>Example of preventing human error: on gmail, if Google recoginizes that you wanted to send an attachment, but did not actually attach anything, they will alert you before the email sends.</li>

        <h2>Ten Commandments of Web Design</h2>
        <p>Jeffrey Zeldman</p>
        <p id="link2"> <a href="http://vimeo.com/84467622">Watch Me</a> </p>
        <p>This video talks about how we can get from pretty good to awesome when it comes to web design. Like the previous video, it puts an emphasis on how the little things can make all the difference. The Ten Commandments of Web Design are:  
            <ul>
                <li>Thou shalt entertain: Keep the user engaged.</li> <li>Test everything: This includes assumptions. Making content available and accessible on all kinds of devices.</li> <li>Thou shalt iterate: It’s what we do. Make variations. Iteration is never done. Constantly making little changes.</li> <li>Thou shalt ship: If you can’t delegate at the pixel level, you’ll never ship. Get your stuff out there before someone else does.</li> <li>Engage thy community: Ex: comments. Mobile apps.</li> <li>Love thy user as thyself:  Be responsive.</li> <li>Remember the content: Content of a site always comes first.</li> <li>Ignore workflow at thy peril: Ex: the workflow of uploading images.</li> <li>Thou shalt prioritize: Get the important stuff done.</li> <li>To thine own self be true: Be the thing that you’re great at.</li>
            </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Alt text: text associated with an image that conveys the same info the image does.</li>
            <li>This is design not religion - make your own choices.</li>
            <li>Content ALWAYS comes first.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>10 Things I Didn't Know About HTML</h2>
        <p>Mathias Bynens</p>
        <p id="link3"> <a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203">Watch Me</a> </p>
        <p>This video talks about the speaker’s things he didn’t know about HTML before he become involved with it, or the things that surprised him. Mathias is a free-lance web designer from Belgium. He branches out beyond HTML and also discusses CSS and JavaScript. The info is very interesting. He starts with HTML validation. Validating your work does not mean your work is done. There are a lot of layers with performance criteria. Next, he discusses character references. They are very important. Are semi colons really optional? NO- they can cause breaks in your content. Next, he talks about tags. You can actually omit the closing head and body tags and it will still be validated. It just makes it more compact. Next, continues with font-family names. He also talks about attribute values, and other things related to JavaScript.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Validators can only check two out of the three layers of performance criteria.</li>
            <li>Semi colons are necessary for proper validation of content.</li>
            <li>If there is white space in the font family name, use quotation marks in the markup. – FALSE.</li>
